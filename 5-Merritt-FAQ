Q: What modifications will be done to the building?<br />
A: None<br />
Q: What amount of outside storage will be needed?<br />
A: There will be some storage outside such as a flatbed trailer, box truck and some equipment until we can get it setup inside. There will be no fertilizer stored outside.<br />
Q: Will there be any chipping pulverizing?<br />
A: Yes, there will be pulverizing inside the building. However, Mr. Jordan will have a small dust collector just outside the building if needed.<br />
Q: If some fertilizer compounds/ingredients are toxic to the skin - how are workers protected and why come into an urban area when the wind will blow particles into the area?<br />
A: It is not toxic if you get it on the skin. If particles do get outside, weeds and plants just grow faster and become greener. Most is AG and food grade which is used in everyday consumption or product use. There will be no volatiles like nitrates or liquid ammonia. Mr. Jordan uses basic ingredients. Major and Minor food ingredients. Fertilizer gets a bad wrap because of volatiles and the association to herbicides and insecticides.

Full protective suits are available for employees to wear if they want. “One of the employees is a chemical engineer she knows we are just working with simple salts.<br />
